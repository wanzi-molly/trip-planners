### Public Review (English)

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Amazing Host & Beautiful Apartment!**

We had a wonderful stay at [Host Name]'s apartment in Seoul! She is truly an exceptional host who went above and beyond to make our visit memorable.

**About the Apartment:**
The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated with Korean cultural elements. We especially loved the world map where guests can pin their home countries - such a thoughtful touch! The location was perfect for exploring Seoul.

**About Our Host:**
[Host Name] was incredibly welcoming and generous. She:
- Gave excellent local recommendations (National Gugak Center, Baecnyunok restaurant, and more - all were fantastic!)
- Shared insights about Korean culture and traditions
- Made us feel truly at home

All of her recommendations were spot-on and helped us discover authentic Seoul experiences we wouldn't have found otherwise. Her hospitality and warmth made this more than just a home exchange - it felt like visiting a friend.

We highly recommend staying with [Host Name] and would love to exchange again in the future. Thank you for everything!
